## basic-recursion

Using **recursion**, write a function called _sumBetween_ that takes two numbers (_start_ and _end_) as parameters and returns the sum of the numbers from start to end. What happens if the start is larger than the end? Make sure the function takes care of this case.

```javascript
sumBetween(2, 7); // ==> 27
sumBetween(2, 5); // ==> 14
sumBetween(5, 2); // ==> 14
```
