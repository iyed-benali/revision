## HTML-CSS-JS

### solve the steps in ascending order and step by step

#### when finished from one, go to the other.

- Create HTML, CSS & JS files and connect them together
- Add Two text input fields, one with a placeholder task, and another with the placeholder color
- Add ONE button below them and an empty unordered list below the button
- In the CSS File, create 3 CSS classes (red, yellow, blue) that set the color of the text.
- In the javascript file, create a javascript function that adds an item list to the unordered list
- If the color value is red, yellow or blue, add the CSS class to the item accordingly
- Do not add a list item if the color value is none of the colors

**NOTE: DO NOT USE jQuery**

#### Example scenario:

In the 'task' input, I will put 'Succeed the assessment'

In the 'color' input, I will put 'red'

When I click on the button, the text 'Succeed the assessment' should be added to the unordered list, written with a red color.
